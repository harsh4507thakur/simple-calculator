Simple Calculator in C++

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in C++.
It performs basic arithmetic operations and demonstrates the use of exception handling.

Features

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Exception handling for division by zero

Handles invalid operation selection

Menu-driven and runs in a loop until the user exits

How to Run

Download the file harsh35.cpp

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

g++ harsh35.cpp -o calculator

Run the executable:

./calculator

Enter two numbers and choose the required operation

Enter 0 to exit the calculator

Exception Handling

Division by zero is checked and handled using try, throw, and catch.

If an invalid operation is selected, an exception message is displayed instead of crashing the program.

Purpose of the Project
This project was created to practice:

Basic C++ programming

Control structures (switch, loops)

Exception handling

Writing clean and modular code
